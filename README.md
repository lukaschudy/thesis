# Robustness of Algorithmic Collusion to Information and Timing Frictions

This repository contains the code, simulation outputs, figures, and LaTeX source for my bachelor's thesis on algorithmic collusion in Q-learning pricing games.

**[Read the final thesis (PDF)](Thesis_writeup/main.pdf)**

The project starts from the pricing environment of Calvano et al. (2020): two independent tabular Q-learning agents repeatedly choose prices in a differentiated-products Bertrand game. The thesis asks whether more realistic information and timing frictions make algorithmic collusion less concerning, or whether those frictions can interact in ways that preserve collusion.

*The three frictions reduce learned collusion in different ways; their interactions are not captured by studying each friction separately.*

The three frictions studied are:

- **Observation latency**: agents observe stale rival prices.
- **Noisy monitoring**: agents observe rival prices with Gaussian index noise.
- **Asynchronous price setting**: agents move on staggered pricing schedules rather than simultaneously.

Collusion is measured using the profit-gain index `Delta`, where `Delta = 0` corresponds to competitive Nash profits and `Delta = 1` corresponds to joint-monopoly profits.

## Main Findings

- Single-friction experiments produce three different shapes:
  - latency creates a sharp initial drop,
  - noise creates a smoother decline,
  - asynchrony creates a step down followed by a plateau.
- Latency and noise compound: together they disrupt learned collusion more strongly than a multiplicative benchmark predicts.
- Asynchrony has an opposite-sign interaction: although it reduces collusion on its own, it partially restores collusion when combined with latency or noise.
- Off-path deviation tests show that the high-collusion combined cells are not just passive focal points; the agents still display punishment and recovery dynamics.

The central lesson is that information and timing frictions cannot be evaluated one at a time. Realistic combinations can change the qualitative effect of a policy instrument.

## Quick Start

To read the final thesis, open:

```text
Thesis_writeup/main.pdf
```

To inspect the main C++ implementation, start with:

```text
Code/ogcode/cpp conversion/src/main_combined.cpp
Code/ogcode/cpp conversion/src/LearningSimulationCombined.cpp
```

The generated figures used in the thesis are in:

```text
Thesis_writeup/figures/
```

## Reproducing the Thesis PDF

The thesis is built with LaTeX/BibTeX. From `Thesis_writeup/`:

```powershell
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
```

The compiled output is `Thesis_writeup/main.pdf`.

## Rebuilding Figures

Most figures are generated from already-computed text outputs. From the relevant folders:

```powershell
python Thesis_writeup/figures/make_all_figures.py
python Code/Heatmaps/make_heatmaps.py
python Code/OffPath/make_offpath_figure.py
```

After regenerating heatmap or off-path figures, copy the updated PDFs/PNGs into `Thesis_writeup/figures/` if you want the thesis PDF to use them.

## Building the C++ Simulator

The simulator is in `Code/ogcode/cpp conversion/` and uses C++17. It defines five executables:

- `ogcode_cpp`: baseline Calvano-style learner
- `ogcode_latency`: observation-latency friction
- `ogcode_noise`: noisy-monitoring friction
- `ogcode_async`: asynchronous-pricing friction
- `ogcode_combined`: unified combined-friction learner

With CMake:

```powershell
cd "Code/ogcode/cpp conversion"
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

On the original Windows setup, I also used the included direct `g++` build script:

```powershell
cd "Code/ogcode/cpp conversion"
.\build_frictions.bat
```

That script expects MSYS2 `g++` at `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\g++.exe`; adjust the `GXX` path if your compiler is elsewhere.

## Reproducibility Notes

The repository includes the simulation outputs used to create the thesis figures. Re-running all simulations from scratch is possible but computationally expensive, especially the combined-friction and off-path playback runs.

The key design choices are:

- baseline pricing environment follows Calvano et al. (2020),
- memory is fixed at one previous-period joint price state,
- price grid uses 15 discrete prices,
- frictions preserve the baseline state size so that results remain comparable,
- combined-friction cells are replicated at `N = 250`, `500`, and `1000` sessions.

See the methodology and appendix in `Thesis_writeup/main.pdf` for the exact economic setup and implementation details.

## Requirements

For figure generation:

- Python 3
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

For the simulator:

- C++17 compiler
- OpenMP support recommended
- CMake 3.16+ if using the CMake build path

For the thesis PDF:

- LaTeX distribution such as MiKTeX or TeX Live
- BibTeX
